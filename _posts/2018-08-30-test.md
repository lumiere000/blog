# Roles in Teampass

Teampass uses 3 roles of possible Users.

## Administrator

The Administrator has to set up Teampass to fit the expectations in term of features.
In order to achieve this goal, his role is to:

* Set the expected options
* Manage the [Folders](./manage-folders.md) (creation, modification and deletion)
* Manage the [Groups](./manage-groups.md) (creation, modification and deletion)
* Manage the Users (creation, modification and deletion)

An Administrator can perform any kind of operation in Teampass except working on Items.

The Administrator is often a member of IT team.

Notice that the Administrator has not access to the Items with his "administrator" account.

## Manager

A Manager in Teampass is a super user that can:

* manage [Folders](./manage-folders.md) (creation, modification and deletion) associated to the [Groups](./manage-groups.md) he belongs to
* manage Users (modification and deletion) on which he is defined as "main administrator"
* of course, deal with Items

A Manager could be a Team leader.

## Human Resources

A Human Resources Manager in Teampass has the same rights as a Manager but he can manage all Users independately of his/her group.

Notice that he will be also promoted to Manager role, and that he will not be able to edit existing administrators.

## User

A User is a normal Teampass user which deals with Items in the way defined by the Administrator and Manager.

# Access to Users Management page

Access to the `Users Management` page.

![Screenshot](https://teampass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/mng-usr-1.png)

# Add a new User

Click the icon `Add a User`

![Screenshot](https://teampass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/mng-usr-2.png)

And fill in the form

![Screenshot](https://teampass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/mng-usr-3.png)

About the form:

* `Name`, `Last name` and `Login` need to be filled in.
* The `Password` is the one the User will need to use to get connected to Teampass.
* `Email` is used to some specific feature of Teampass.
* `User is administrated by` setting is important. By default, Administrators will manage the Users, but you can also decide that this management could be delegated to the Manager of a Role. In this case, select the Role manager.
* Next 3 settings `Is admin`, `Is Manager` and `Is read only` are related to the permission of the User inside Teampass.
* If `Personal folder` is ticked, then the Personal Folder for this User will be created.
* If `Create folder and role for ***` is ticked, then you can imagine what will happen.

The new User is now added to the list.

![Screenshot](https://teampass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/mng-usr-4.png)

You now need to associate this new User to one or more Groups. Click on the `Edit icon` at the left of the User.

![Screenshot](https://teampass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/mng-usr-5.png)

Perform the change you want on this User using the dialog box that appears.

![Screenshot](https://teampass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/mng-usr-6.png)

With:

* `Groups` field permits you to select the Groups that this user belongs to
* `Managed by` field permits you to select what Manager (or Administrator) will manage this user.
* `Allowed Folders` field permits you to select Folders to which the User will have access even if not allowed by the Groups he is associated to (see next chapter for more explanations)
* `Denied Folders` field permits you to select Folders to which the User will NOT have access even if allowed by the Groups he is associated to (see next chapter for more explanations)

# Allowed and Forbidden Folders

Each user is associated to Groups. This means he/she can access the Folders defined through the Group.

Nevertheless you can decide to allow this User to access other Folders than the one allowed by the Group.
For this, you need to use setting `Allowed Folders`.

You can also decide to restrict the access to some Folders using the setting `Forbidden Folders`.

	This should be very rare and for specific case. If it is regularly used, you should think about arranging your Roles.

# Lock and Delete a User

For some reason, you could need to lock a User. This will prevent the User from connecting to Teampass.

![Screenshot](https://teampass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/mng-usr-7.png)

When a user is locked, this red icon appears at the left:

![Screenshot](https://teampass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/mng-usr-8.png)

You can only `delete` a User that has been previously `locked`. For this, tick the corresponding checkbox and save.

![Screenshot](https://teampass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/mng-usr-9.png)

To `unlock` a locked User, tick the corresponding checkbox and save.

![Screenshot](https://teampass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/mng-usr-10.png)

# Change the User role

You can change the User level by using the selectors.

![Screenshot](https://teampass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/mng-usr-11.png)

The Users Levels are:

* `Is Admin`: tick (1) to change the User to Administrator
* `Is Manager`: tick (2) to change the User to Manager
* `Is Read Only`: tick (3) to change the User to become Read Only
* `Is Human Resources`: tick (4) to change the User to Human Resources Manager

# Special actions

Using the selectors, you can quickly perform the following actions on a User.

![Screenshot](https://teampass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/mng-usr-12.png)

* Allow to `create folders on Root level`
* Enable or disable `Personal Folders`
* Change the User's `Password`
* Change the User's `Email`
* See the `Log`






# Manage the Groups

A Group contains a set of Users. It simplifies the administration of access rights on Folders.
Indeed access rights on Folders are defined by Groups.

A good practice is to organize the Users Group by team or groups of interest.

	Notice that a User may be associated to several User Groups.

# Example

Let's consider 3 Users (Us1, Us2 and Us3), 2 Folders (Fld1 and Fld2), and 2 Users Group (UG1 and UG2) defined as below:

* UG1 contains Us1, Us2 and Us3. It is associated to Fld2
* UG2 contains Us2. It is associated to Fld1

Based on this assumption, Us2 is the unique user to have access to both Fdl1 and Fld2.

# Access to Group Management page

Access to the `Group Management` page.

![Screenshot](https://teampass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/mng-grp-1.png)

# Creating a new Group

Click the icon `Add a Group`

![Screenshot](https://teampass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/mng-grp-2.png)

And fill in the form

![Screenshot](https://teampass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/mng-grp-3.png)

About the form:

* The label is the name of the Group.
* The `Required complexity` corresponds to the minimum password complexity level that a User password (that belong to this Group) needs to fulfill.

The new Group is now added to the list.

![Screenshot](https://teampass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/mng-grp-4.png)

# Edit a Group

To edit, click the `edit icon`.

![Screenshot](https://teampass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/mng-grp-5.png)

And edit it through the dialog box

![Screenshot](https://teampass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/mng-grp-6.png)

# Delete a Group

To delete, click the `edit icon` and Confirm.

![Screenshot](https://teampass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/mng-grp-7.png)

	Users belonging to this Group will need to be associated to another Group.

# Using the rights matrix

The `rights matrix` permits to allow or deny the access of Users in a Group to Folders.

To ease its understanding, the `rights matrix` uses colors and icons to indicate the specific rights set for a Group on a Folder.

* `Red` cell indicates that the Group is not allowed to access the folder
* `Yellow` cell indicates that the Group is allowed to View only
* `Green` cell indicates that the Group has access to the Folder
* `Blue` cell indicates that the Group has access to the Folder but with specific restrictions

Small icons indicate the restrictions in place for a Group on a Folder.

![Screenshot](https://teampass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/mng-grp-8.png)

This matrix is very powerful and visible. As you can see in the previous screen-capture.

![Screenshot](https://teampass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/mng-grp-9.png)

# Allow access to all Items

This feature is disabled by default and is unsecure but it may be helpful.

Its aim is to permit the Users of a Group to have the right to edit/modify all Items they have access to.
It will bypass the settings set for each Item.

	Only activate this for a Group with limited Users.

To activate this, click on the icon as shown in next screen-capture.

![Screenshot](https://teampass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/img/mng-grp-10.png)

# Who can manage Groups

Creation, modification and deletion can only be performed by an `Administrator` or a `Manager`.

Notes:

* The Manager will only see the Group that he is associated to.
* Deleting a User Group will not delete the associated Users.
