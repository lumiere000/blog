Clonezilla will prompt a mbr/gpt mismatch error when cloning windows 10, because Windows 8 or 10 uses an MBR disk in legacy mode, but UEFI requires GPT.

To prevent an unnecessary mistake, here comes a very useful software, easy to use, ssd support, fast, lightweight and FREEEEEEE!

AOMEI Backupper is a Clonezilla live, Acronis True Image, Norton Ghost alike software, it can also create an USB boot disk, it can clone form a larger disk to a small one (of cause the usage of larger disk cannot over the small one).
