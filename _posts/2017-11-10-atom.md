How to connect atom to github

```
1. Download atom
2. On the welcome screen, click to go to 'git'
3. On Github panel, login with authentication token
 get your token here : https://github.atom.io/auth/github_package/token
4. Open project
5. On github preview, see message about not being able to automatically pin
6. Enter URL of pull request
Will get : This branch is pinned to the pull request at this URL https://github.com/username/ but we couldn't find a pull request at that URL.
Thats normal and you can start pull and open git panel from Package > github > toggle git tab commit > push
```
